# HM_UI_testing
# UI testing web framework example

I have taken one e-commerce project [HM](https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/index.html) to test it with Python.

## Installation

Use the package manager to install all the packages.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
